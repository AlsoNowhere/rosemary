This is a node script that allows turning a C# model into a modellerizer model.

It turns the following:
public string Example { get; set; }
into this:
model.add("Example","string");

It adds attributes:
[Required]
public string Example { get; set; }
->
model.add("Example","string");
model.validation("Example","Required");

Use by defining the .cs file to target from (no need to put .cs on the end)
and the name of the .js file to create or overwrite (no need to put .js on the end):

node modellerizer User user
